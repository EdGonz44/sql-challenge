## EmployeeSQL 
The EmployeeSQL folder contains the data on the company's employee/department records. The folder also contains the .sql files that contain the queries used to establsih the tables that the data csv files would be imported into, as well an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that depicts how these tables are related to each other through primary and foreign keys.

### Data
Inside the data folder are several csv files named after the information that is held within them. After the tables for these csv files were created, they would then be imported into table swith similar names, in order to keep the naming conventions organized.

### SQLCode
Within the SQL code folder, there are two .sql files that describe both the table schemata for the tables that were produced through querying, and a file that describes the code used in the queries. The .png file is an image of the ERD file depcting how the tables are related to each other when querying them. 

#### ERD
![ERD file](https://github.com/EdGonz44/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/SQL_code/ERD.png) 

The Entity Relationship Diagram depicted above describes the 6 tables that were created in order to store the data from the csv files. Each table describes the relevant datatype and limitations used for each column within the tables, as well as their naming within the table. The image of a key next to the name of one of the columns within the table denotes it as the primary key used in said table, with multiple keys in a table used to represent a composite key within the table.
